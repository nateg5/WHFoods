          <h2 id="privpol">Privacy Policy and Visitor Agreement</h2>WHFoods.org (WHF) and the George Mateljan Foundation respect the privacy of visitors to our site. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand our privacy practices. Questions regarding privacy issues should be directed to WHFoods.org in care of William Meyer, Dwyer Schraff Meyer Grant &amp; Green at 1800 Pioneer Plaza, 900 Fort Street Mall, Honolulu, Hawaii 96813.
          <p>Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. We won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to register with any of our sites or to provide any other personally identifying information.</p>
          <p>The information gathered by WHFoods.org falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to our websites when they register or initiate transactions, and (2) tracking information gathered as visitors navigate through our sites. Third party providers featured on or linked to by our websites, such as vendors of products and services offered through our sites, may be gathering the same kinds of information.</p>
          <p>To make use of certain features on our websites (such as chat rooms and other interactive forums) visitors need to register and to provide certain information as part of the registration process. We may also ask for information from those who want more personalized recipes, buy products or services or conduct other transactions on our websites. (We may ask, for example, for your name, email address, gender, age, zip code or credit card number or any diseases you suffer.) The information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our sites to your interests and make them more useful to you, and to process e-commerce transactions.</p>
          <p>The more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. Supplying such information is entirely voluntary. But if you don't supply the information we need, we may be unable to provide you with services we make available to other visitors to our sites. For example, we can't offer you a personalized diet if you don't tell us about your demographics (age, gender, ethnic background, and disease problems). And we can't send you email alerting you to a new service we're offering, or breaking news that may interest you if you don't tell us what you're interested in and give us your email address.</p>
          <p>Of course, even if you want to remain completely anonymous, you're still free to take advantage of the wealth of content available on our sites without registration.</p>
          <p>To help make our sites more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we invoke a standard feature of browser software, called a "cookie," to assign each visitor a unique, random number, a sort of user ID, if you will, that resides on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we won't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie can't read unrelated data off your hard drive.</p>
          <p>We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs, to deliver a better, more personalized service. It is a cookie, for example, that allows us to deliver your personalized recipes, even if you've been away for a while. In addition, we may use cookies to track the pages on our sites visited by our users. We can build a better site if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. Of course, you can set your browser not to accept cookies, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other visitors to our sites.</p>
          <p>Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our sites. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally to us. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our sites to the interests of our users, and to measure traffic within our sites.</p>
          <p>To make our sites more valuable to our visitors, we may offer some features in conjunction with other providers. We share with these third parties such information as is necessary to provide the products or services, but we do not sell or provide email addresses to any third parties that market unrelated products or services. And, of course, our sites include links to other websites, and provide access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we don't control. When you access another website or purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through our websites, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you're visiting or the provider of such products or services. And when you provide information in the course of obtaining products or services through one of our sites, use of any information you provide may be governed by the privacy policy of the provider of those products or services, even if it appears that you're on our website. The provider's privacy policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of our provider partners via a link either from the site's homepage or from the pages on which the products or services are offered, you should contact the provider directly for more information. All information gathered on any WHF website is encrypted for storage within a WHF-controlled database. However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a message you post to any chat room, forum or other public posting area is available to anyone with Internet access. If you don't want people to know your email address, for example, don't include it in any message you post publicly.</p>
          <p>The mailing list for our newsletter is managed by AWeber Communications, which has its own email privacy policy located at http://www.aweber.com/permission.htm. When you subscribe to our newsletter, the email address you provide for that purpose will only be used according to this policy. Please review these terms before subscribing to our newsletter.</p>
          <p>We reserve the right to release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our Terms and Conditions of Use, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our sites, the public, or WHFoods.org.</p>
          <p>A final note: The Web is an evolving medium. If we need to change our privacy policy at some point in the future, we'll post the changes before they take effect. By visiting any of our sites, you agree that your visit, and any dispute over our privacy practices, is governed by this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions of Use.</p>

          <p>The material that appears on WHFoods.org is for informational purposes only. Despite our efforts to provide useful and accurate information, errors may appear from time to time. Before you act on information you've found on our site, you should confirm any facts that are important to your decision. WHFoods.org is not responsible for, and cannot guarantee the performance of, any products provided by the sites we may link. A link to another Web site does not constitute an endorsement of that site (nor of any product, service or other material offered on that site) by WHFoods.org or its licensors.</p>
          <p>We may change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the WHF Web Site at any time, including the availability of any WHP Web Site feature, database, or Content. WHF may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the WHF Web Site without notice or liability. We reserve the right to make changes, corrections, and improvements to the WHF Web Site, and to the products and programs described in the Site, at any time without notice.</p>
          <p>You represent, warrant and covenant that; (a) you shall not upload, post or transmit to or distribute or otherwise publish through the WHF Web Site any materials which (i) restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the WHF Web Site, (ii) are unlawful, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, offensive, pornographic, profane, sexually explicit or indecent, (iii) constitute or encourage conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate law, (iv) violate, plagiarize or infringe the rights of third parties including, without limitation, copyright, trademark, patent, rights of privacy or publicity or any other proprietary right, (v) contain a virus or other harmful component, (vi) contain any information, software or other material of a commercial nature, (vii) contain advertising of any kind, or (viii) constitute or contain false or misleading indications of origin or statements of fact; and (b) that you are at least eighteen (18) years old.</p>
          <p>The WHF Web Site may contain inaccuracies or typographical errors or omissions. We regret any such errors, but will not be bound by any such errors.

You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such opinion, advice, statement, memorandum, or information shall be at your sole risk.

          <p>The staff of WHFoods.org does its best to ensure that information we post to this site is both timely and accurate. But the health information changes over time and research that was accurate when posted may be superceded by more recent research. Though we may post follow-up research, and may continue to provide access to the original report, as in an archive of Healthy Foods News, for example, we don't go back and change the original report to reflect new developments. If you're looking for the most recent information on a given subject, and not the history of how the story unfolded, be sure you're not looking at an out of date report.</p>
          <p>To obtain access to certain services on our site, you may be given an opportunity to register with WHFoods.org. As part of any such registration process, you will select a user name and a password. You agree that the information you supply during that registration process will be accurate and complete and that you will not register under the name of, nor attempt to enter the service under the name of, another person. WHFoods.org reserves the right to reject or terminate any user name that, in its judgment, it deems offensive. You will be responsible for preserving the confidentiality of your password and will notify WHFoods.org of any known or suspected unauthorized use of your account. As part of the registration process, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Please review them both carefully.</p>
