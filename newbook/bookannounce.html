    This is to notify you that we are completely out of books. A second edition has been a work-in-progress for the last two years. Our goal is to create the most outstanding book containing information supported by the latest science. In that endeavor we have spent the years updating the scientific material with over 10,000 scientific articles having been reviewed in the process. Because the book is getting close to completion George has decided not to print additional copies of the current book (printed in 2006) as he would like Readers to benefit from the new material (over 50%) found in the second edition. We are speeding up the process to bring the book to completion as soon as possible, and we will have a better idea of when this might be in the next couple of months. We will be sure to keep you posted as to our progress.

      <p style="font-size:14pt; font-weight:bold;">The World's Healthiest Foods book<br>
      by George Mateljan</p>
    </center>
    <p style="font-size:200%; font-weight:bold;">Did you ever think that these times of economic turndown and struggling economy could actually be beneficial to your health? By purchasing nutrient-rich foods and preparing great-tasting, health-promoting foods at home, you can not only save money but improve your health! The World's Healthiest Foods book will help you do just that.</p>
    <p></p>
    <div style="background-color:#FFEEAA; padding:10px;">
      Dear Friend of WHFoods,
      <p>In these times of sinking stock prices and economic downturrn there is a new zeal for cooking at home. And surprisingly enough this can become the new secret for eating more of the right kind of foods to help you enjoy better health, increase your energy, improve your memory, protect your heart, promote permanent weight-loss, and slow down aging.</p>
      <p>And it's easy with my Healthiest Way of Cooking methods and 500 recipes highlighting the health-promoting, nutrient-rich World's Healthiest Foods. The foods not only taste great, they provide a rich concentration of nutrients. Most recipes take 7 minutes or less to prepare with less than 5 ingredients and you can even prepare an entire meal in 15 minutes! And 100 of the recipes don't require any cooking at all!</p>
      <p>I discovered the World's Healthiest Foods by traveling the world&mdash;to 80 different countries&mdash;looking for foods that were associated with health and longevity. By eating the World's Healthiest Foods prepared in ways that retain the maximum number of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, you can help prevent high blood pressure, insomnia, fatigue or obesity and enjoy greater overall health and vitality.</p>
      <p>My innovative <i>al dente</i> method of cooking is just one example of how these cooking methods can save you a lot of valuable time and are so easy that I don't even consider them cooking methods as much as food preparation techniques.</p>
      <p>You will love my 1-Minute Mediterranean Spinach, 5-Minute Healthy-Sauteed Cauliflower, 7-Minute Creamy Butternut Squash, 10-Minute Quick-Broiled Salmon with Salsa, and luscious fresh fruit desserts that are made without sugar and take only 10 minutes to prepare. And 100 of these recipes require no cooking at all!</p>
      <p>It has taken me 10 years to write this book and share with you all that I have researched and learned through my personal experiences with the health-promoting World's Healthiest Foods. Like me, you will feel energized by enjoying these antioxidant-rich foods which reduce the amount of free radicals in your body. The nutrients in these foods can help enhance your immune system as they have mine (I haven't had a cold or experienced the flu for 10 years!). Their nutrients help enhance brain function and so you may find yourself with better memory and concentration like I have. By following the Healthiest Way of Eating you'll also enjoy foods that have anti-inflammatory properties and help to promote heart health. And you can lose 50 pounds in a year, like I did&mdash;my normal weight is now 50 pounds lighter than before I started the Healthiest Way of Eating, and I feel great!</p>
      <p><b>New Way of Cooking Without Destroying Vitamins, Minerals and Antioxidants and the Food Tastes Great!</b></p>
      <p>The Healthiest Way of Cooking techniques I have developed represent a new wave of cooking for the 21st century. Did you know that traditional cooking methods can lose up to 50-80% of the vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytonutrients found in food? My new cooking methods not only retain the majority of nutrients but are also much quicker and easier. In fact most food can be prepared in a matter of minutes!</p>
      <p>My innovative <i>al dente</i> method of cooking is just one example of how my cooking methods can save you a lot of valuable time and are so easy that I don't even consider them cooking methods as much as food preparation techniques.</p>
      <p>And all of the 500-plus recipes were created to enhance the flavor of the World's Healthiest Foods so they are not only easy-to-prepare&mdash;most take 7 minutes or less and contain 5 or fewer ingredients&mdash;but they taste great! I will also show you how in this short amount of time you can make dishes that taste extraordinary as well as how to prepare a 5-course meal in only 15 minutes!</p>
      <p>You will love my 1-Minute Mediterranean Spinach, 5-Minute Healthy-Sauteed Cauliflower, 7-Minute Creamy Butternut Squash, 10-Minute Quick-Broiled Salmon with Salsa, and luscious fresh fruit desserts that are made without sugar and take only 10 minutes to prepare. And 100 of my recipes require no cooking at all!</p>
      <p><b>Powerful 4-Weeks Healthiest Eating Plan Features Over 100% of the Daily Values for Most Essential Vitamins and Minerals (as well as many powerful antioxidants and phytonutrients)</b></p>
      <p>The powerful, health-promoting 4-Weeks Healthiest Way of Eating Plan (page 29) does all of the work for you by combining the World's Healthiest Foods in ways so you enjoy 100% of your nutritional needs everyday. Since most health problems are cause by nutrient deficiencies it can help correct nutritional deficiencies that are related to insomnia, fatigue, memory loss, obesity and a host of other conditions. Follow the Healthiest Way of Eating Plan and take control of your health.</p>
      <p>For over 30 years I was told it would be impossible for food alone (without taking supplements) to supply enough nutrients to promote optimal health. With my Healthiest Way of Eating Plan, I proved them wrong. My Plan does just that; it features over 100% of the daily value for essential nutrients. And you don't have to break the bank to follow the Plan; you actually get more for your money because it provides you with health insurance for excellent health that really works! You can buy these powerful health-promoting foods for no more than what you are spending on food now if you eat healthy. And they are much less expensive than supplements.</p>
      <p>By providing 100% of the daily value of nutrients the Plan allows for the synergistic interaction of nutrients, which helps you to reap the maximum health-promoting benefits from your Healthiest Way of Eating&mdash;reduced free radical activity, reduced inflammation, increased energy and promoting a healthy heart. With the Healthiest Way of Eating you are also assured of getting as many of the miracle healing phytonutrients (plant nutrients) as possible. Since it is estimated that there are 40,000 yet to be discovered, eating the World's Healthiest Foods is one of the most sure-fired ways of obtaining these nutrients.</p>
      <p>You most likely are already trying to eat pretty healthfully but you may be missing some key nutrients without even knowing it.

    <p><font style="font-weight:bold; font-size:200%">No Matter How Good a Food is for You, You Won't Eat It If It Doesn't Taste Good&mdash;My Cooking Methods and Recipes Make Them Taste Great!</font></p>
    <p><img src="../newbook/5-salmon-with-salsa.jpg" align="right">"Healthy foods" have long gained the reputation of being good for you but having little or no taste, or tasting horrible. So I have spent many years developing not only nutritious recipes but recipes and cooking methods that make the World's Healthiest Foods taste great. My <i>al dente</i> method of cooking is just one example of how you can increase the flavor and nutrition of your food and prepare it in a matter of minutes.</p>
    <p><b>Make Great-Tasting Foods in 7-Minutes or Less with 5 or Fewer Ingredients to Fit Your Busy Lifestyle</b></p>
    <p>And not only do the recipes taste great, they are easy to prepare so they can fit into today's busy lifestyle. Yes, it may seem unbelievable but you can make most of my 500 recipes found in <i>The World's Healthiest Foods</i> book in 7 minutes or less and using 5 or fewer ingredients! Never before has cooking been so convenient, nutritious and tasty:</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <p></p>
      <li>Mediterranean Swiss chard in 3 minutes
        <p></p>

    <p><b>Cooking Food <i>Al Dente</i>: A Breakthrough, Innovative Way to Cook that Retains the Maximum Number of Nutrients as Well as Taste</b></p>
    <p><img src="../newbook/6-healthy-saute.jpg" align="left">Many traditional cooking methods result in overcooked foods that not only lose from 50-80% of their nutrients but most of their taste and texture as well. That's why I dedicated years to perfect the <i>al dente</i> method of cooking &mdash;to retain not only the majority of nutrients such as the vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants found in food but its taste and texture as well.</p>
    <p>Only in <i>The World's Healthiest Foods</i> book will you find the new and innovative way to cook your vegetables <i>al dente</i>. Usually reserved for the cooking of pasta, I adopted this concept to cook vegetables that retain the maximum number of nutrients and taste&mdash;they are cooked just long enough to soften their fibers.</p>
    <p>This is important because as the fibers are softened they free up thousands of nutrients for easier digestion and absorption allowing the body to convert them to energy. At the same time you'll enjoy the discovery of new and hidden flavors that you did not know existed before. That's what <i>al dente</i> cooking is all about.</p>
    <p>With my <i>al dente</i> method of cooking combined with the right combination of healthy ingredients including herbs and spices, vegetables will come to feel like an indulgence rather than something you are supposed to eat. For example, cook your broccoli <i>al dente</i> and combine with feta cheese and olives for a taste sensation. Combine it with a piece of Quick-Broiled salmon, which only takes minutes to prepare, and you have a healthy meal that you will want to serve to your most finicky friends.</p>
    <p><b>Is the Healthiest Way of Eating&mdash;a Mediterranean-Style of Eating&mdash;One of the Healthiest Ways of Eating Anywhere in the World?</b></p>
    <p><img src="../newbook/7-olive-oil.jpg" align="left">Yes. The Healthiest Way of Eating is similar to a Mediterranean-style of eating. Scientific research continues to find the Mediterranean-style diet a heart-healthy diet that is one of the healthiest in the world. Rich in fresh fruits, vegetables, fish, beans, grains, goat cheese, olive oil, and red wine it is very similar to our Healthiest Way of Eating. And it is renowned for its great taste!</p>
    <p><b>What Readers are Saying About Our Great-Tasting Recipes:</b></p>
    <p><img src="../newbook/8-cucumber-salad.html" align="right"><i>This book is truly amazing! The book is easy to read and the recipes are simple, fast and delicious. You don't need a long list of ingredients for any of the recipes, and the longest part of preparing any of the meals is cutting up the veggies. My family calls this the cooking bible, because we refer to it every evening. I have come to love whole foods more than I thought possible and I have tried foods I never knew existed. Thank you George for all your wisdom.</i> - <b>Zeta</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><i>Just wanted to thank you again for this really spectacular recipe! . . My husband requested that I make another batch this week (he virtually never asks for anything specific). Zesty Mexican Soup has everything.healthy protein, lots of vegetables, great flavor&mdash;it's so easy and quick to prepare and tastes just as good even 2-3 days later! The recipe made enough that I filled 3 quart jars and put them in our refrigerator. We enjoyed it for lunch or dinner for several days.</i> - <b>AN</b></p>
    <p><i>I think it is an amazing book. I knew that broccoli was an extremely healthy food but stopped cooking it because my husband complained about how it made the house smell. Your steaming method works so well (no smell) and I was absolutely delighted when my 12-year old and 9-year old asked if I could please make that broccoli again because it was so good!! My kids are pretty healthy eaters, but not when it comes to vegetables so I am so excited to continue experimenting with your vegetable recipes that they might finally eat. My wake up call was a check up with high cholesterol. I am committed to a lifestyle change with more healthy food choices. Thank you so much for making this so much easier to do with your book as a guide.</i> - <b>Diane</b></p>
    <p><i>I just wanted you to know that I tried your Golden Squash Soup recipe and it was amazing. It's the first recipe I've tried from WHF and I must say you've made a fantastic first impression. Very flavorful and fresh. I'll be keeping a close eye on your recipe section and trying as many as I can. Thank you very much for sharing these with us.</i> - <b>Tony</b></p>
    <p><i>For anyone who is seeking guidelines for healthier eating, this is your best source. There are over 800 pages of information that is concise, neatly organized, and easily found. I have been cooking for over 40 years and am learning new things from this book all the time.</i> - <b>AV</b></p>
    <p><i>George Mateljan's view on food is illuminating. He looks at food as a vehicle for maximizing health as the first priority through preparation that maximizes nutrition while achieving the best taste. He never budges from this mantra. His efforts fill your mind with the facts and history of each of his chosen foods. For me, his book helps me fortify my mind to be a little stronger against the daily temptations of America's food marketing machine.</i> - <b>Mark</b></p>
    <p><i>This is the best, most comprehensive guide to selecting and preparing foods I've ever seen. Although I have taken a college-level nutrition course, I found the book very informative and a supplement to my existing knowledge. I have learned so many things about food preparation that are not common knowledge.even as someone who loves to cook and who reads much information related to cooking and nutrition. It also provides many recipe options, which allow one to innovate with whatever ingredients are available at the time. I enjoy consulting this book everyday.</i> - <b>AN</b></p>

    <p>Nutrient-richness is the key to the World's Healthiest Foods and the Healthiest Way of Eating. It is the measurement of how many nutrients (vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, protein, fiber, and omega-3 fatty acids) you will receive from your food for the least number of calories.</p>
    <p>Since the World's Healthiest Foods are some of the most nutrient-rich foods around, you won't have to worry about getting all of the vitamins and minerals you need if you make them the foundation of your Healthiest Way of Eating. Along with vitamins and minerals, they are concentrated in antioxidants and phytonutrients, which combat free radicals that can damage DNA and cellular structures, as well as act as powerful anti-inflammatory agents. And their rich source of fiber can help stabilize blood sugar levels and protect against diabetes.</p>
    <p><b>The World's Healthiest Foods are Whole Foods That Are Closest to Their Natural State</b></p>
    <p><img src="../newbook/4-squash-on-vine.jpg" align="left">Whole foods are as close as possible to their natural state and contain all of the healthy nutritional substances which provide good health. They are not sugary, refined foods filled with additives and preservatives. They are foods richest in health-promoting nutrients rather than foods that are full of empty calories. That's why making the World's Healthiest Foods the foundation of your diet will help give you a body that expresses all that you are meant to be&mdash;healthy and filled with energy to live life to its fullest.</p>
    <p><b>The Health-Promoting World's Healthiest Foods Keep You Healthy by Supporting Your Natural Health-Promoting Capabilities</b></p>
    <p>Eating to support your natural health-promoting capabilities is not a new concept. Over 2,000 years ago, Hippocrates, the Greek physician and the father of modern medicine declared, "Food is your medicine." The Healthiest Way of Eating is the way to put this age-old philosophy into practice today.</p>
    <p>Science tells us that our body has innate protective mechanisms to keep us healthy. Two million people die every year from preventable diseases in the United States such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and others. So how can these diseases be prevented? By taking one simple step&mdash;start eating health-promoting foods like the World's Healthiest Foods and reduce your intake of nutrient-poor foods such as overly refined and overly sweet foods, which we often refer to as junk food. The Healthiest Way of Eating provides the body with the nutrients that it need to do the job it is innately capable of helping to prevent disease and maintain health.</p>
    <p>Even people long devoted to healthy eating often express their lack of knowledge or confusion about the best way to do this. That's why I wrote <i>The World's Healthiest Foods</i>! Combine the knowledge you will discover in this book with proper exercise and you have the formula for optimal health.</p>
    <p>But just don't take my word about the benefits of the World's Healthiest Foods and the Healthiest Way of Eating&mdash;we have received testimonials from thousands of Readers of both the website and book attesting to the remarkable health benefits they have enjoyed since changing to a Healthiest Way of Eating with the World's Healthiest Foods:</p>
    <p><b>Mood benefits:</b></p>
    <p><i>I think your web site has probably SAVED MY LIFE. I write this with tears in my eyes because I know I was near the end of a very dangerous path. It was depression and a lack of interest in food - nothing tasted good anymore, so I just didn't eat. My Doctor told me I was in the early stage of some serious malnutrition. I do not know if I have gained any weight since I found your web site, but at least I do not feel like I am wasting away anymore. I have started eating at least twice a day and very good wholesome, nutrition rich, delicious food. I wanted to thank you for your web site. If I hadn't seen the world's healthiest foods list I know I would still be on that same dangerous path I was on. WHFOODS has life altering, magical healing powers within. I keep WHFoods on my Bookmark Bar and visit almost every day!!</i> - <b>Karen</b></p>
    <p><i>For the first time in my life, I feel so happy to just be me. My mood has completely changed. I'm motivated. I have confidence. I feel healthy! Not once do I feel deprived because, like I said, I don't have cravings anymore! My friends ask me how I do it, and I tell them... it's all about The World's Healthiest Foods. I feel great, and I'm still losing weight! Now I can't wait to get into that bride's maid's dress! Thank you so much, for changing my life.</i> - <b>Amy</b></p>
    <p><b>Lowering cholesterol:</b></p>
    <p><i>Aware that I am quite predisposed to heart disease, I have been watching what I eat and have really made use of your newsletters and website. Last week I met with my doctor to go over my latest cholesterol tests. Before going in I was feeling discouraged with the two deaths in this past year, thinking that even though I have been trying to make good choices, for me it probably would not make any difference, I was prepared to go on medication. Well, surprise, my cholesterol had gone down substantially and is now in a very low normal range. My doctor was quite surprised to see the change and noted that it was very unusual to see such a drop without medication. Thank you again for this wonderful website!</i> - <b>Theresa</b></p>
    <p><i>I am 74 years old and have had high cholesterol levels for years. For a year or so I have been studying the information on your site and adjusting my diet. A few days ago my doctor called me with the lab results -- healthier in all areas! And my high cholesterol was down about 50 points. The doctor told me my diet practices have paid off! Your brilliant site is an ever-updated, research-supported, and rewarding resource. Thank you so much&mdash;you are a shining example of what the Internet can do for people.</i> - <b>SM</b></p>
    <p><b>Menopausal symptoms:</b></p>
    <p><i>Thank You!!!: I just needed to thank you for changing my life. This information has created a better, healthier, more energetic me. I have lost close to 30 pounds by changing my way of eating and have lost all of my crazy menopausal symptoms which was my main reason for researching a change in diet, since I did not want to resort to hormones unless absolutely necessary. I just love all the wonderful information, and have directed many people to your site. I was a terrible fast food, processed food eater, never drank water or ate any kind of fruit. Now, just the thought of fast food makes me sick. I just couldn't let this change in my life go without thanking you so much for helping me.</i> - <b>DL</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Lowering blood pressure:</b></p>
    <p><i>I just want to tell you what a blessing your site has been to me since I found it about 3 weeks ago.I have used several recipes and I hardly eat anything without running the nutritional value of it on whfoods. I am feeling better than ever, losing some weight, and my blood pressure is under control for the first time in about 2 years. Thanks again for all you do.</i> - <b>Danny</b></p>
    <p><b>Younger and healthier:</b></p>
    <p><i>Many thanks: I discovered this website about a year ago, around the time that I decided to radically change my diet. WHFoods has been my primary resource. There's so much to learn here, and I've only scratched the surface. I often refer to the list of the 100 healthiest foods to remind myself what to pick up at the store. I'm 34, and my body looks as it did when I was 24. My skin is healthy, I have ample energy, my sexual vitality has increased and I haven't had a cold in over a year. I'm grateful for the generosity of WHFoods and the joyful spirit with which it offers its information and guidance. It's great to have a partner in the quest for optimal health, and it makes me want to share the message with others. It also gives me insight into the immense food-related suffering that exists in our society. I hope to find ways to relieve some of that suffering, now that I've relieved a bit of my own.</i> - <b>Jonathan</b></p>
    <p><i>Since I have started to use the WHFoods List as the basis for my diet, I have experienced a tremendous improvement in my overall feeling of well-being. I no longer get headaches, muscle aches, heartburn or joint paint. They used to be a part of my daily life. I am losing weight by making a permanent change in my eating habits rather than dieting (which always resulted in a greater weight gain after I completed the diet). I never feel deprived in any way, and I am enjoying eating as much as I ever did. I just no longer experience all those unpleasant side effects from eating unhealthy, high-calorie foods.</i> - <b>Victoria</b></p>

    <p><b>What the 4-Weeks Plan Will Do for You&mdash;Protect Your Cells and DNA from Free Radical Damage, Improve Your Immune System, Reduce Inflammation and Protect Your Heart</b></p>
    <p>4-Week Meal Plan will help you stay focused, sharp and energized all day. It is the best Plan to provide you with all the nutrients you need every day. Here's how it works:</p>
    <p><img src="../newbook/9-Week-1.jpg" align="left"><b>Week 1 - Cleanse body of deadly free radicals and increase your energy</b><br>
    Antioxidant-rich foods help to combat the free radical activity that results in damaging DNA and cellular structures. Since antioxidants work synergistically, we need to eat a variety of antioxidant-rich foods for optimal protection.</p>
    <p><img src="../newbook/10-Week-2.jpg" align="left"><b>Week 2 - Supercharge your immune system</b><br>
    Good health means a strong immune system making every organ in your body stronger and more resilient. Eating foods rich in vitamin C such as lemons, oranges, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli are absolutely critical for optimal immunity. A strong immune system can translate into experiencing fewer colds and flues and a slowing down of the aging process.</p>
    <p><img src="../newbook/11-Week-3.jpg" align="left"><b>Week 3 - Reduce inflammation, the key to healthy organs</b><br>
    Inflammation can attack any part of your body and cause cellular damage to your liver, kidneys, thyroid, eyes, and heart. The best foods to help reduce inflammation are the omega-3 fatty acids of which most people need 2.5-4.0 g each day.</p>
    <p>Reducing inflammation can help:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Prevent memory loss - omega-3s nourish your brain; they have been shown to help protect your brain's neurotransmitters, which are the foundation for memory, moods.</li>
      <li>Reduce joint pain</li>
      <li>Keep skin elastic and free of wrinkles. Staying fresh and smooth.</li>
      <li>Promote healthy lung function</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="../newbook/12-Week-4.jpg" align="left"><b>Week 4 - Protect Your Heart</b><br>
    Heart-healthy foods in the Plan are rich in monunsaturated fats and omega-3 fatty acids, which help maintain strong healthy arteries, great circulation, a healthy heart, and much more:</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <p></p>
      <li>Promotes normal blood pressure
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li>Improves HDL/LDL cholesterol ratio
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li>Protects heart from free radicals
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li>Promotes healthy circulation

    <p>So the World's Healthiest Foods are the best multi-vitamin and mineral (as well as other nutrients) supplements on earth.</p>
    <p>* The U.S. Food and Drug Administrations "Reference Values for Nutrition Labeling" was chosen to use as our standard for the Daily Value (DV).</p>
    <p><b>Why You Need Nutrients Everyday&mdash;Because Only Limited Amounts of Water-Soluble Vitamins Be Stored in the Body</b></p>
    <p>Water-soluble nutrients (such as vitamin C and vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B12, and folic acid) are not made in the body and can only be stored in the body in limited amounts (if, at all), so you need to consume foods rich in them each day for your health to be at its best. Our bodies are very adaptive and can obviously survive on less than the recommended amount of nutrients each day but not without cost to our well-being. The effects may go unnoticed for a while as they may be very subtle or they may take a long time to fully develop. The 4-Weeks Plan ensures you get all the nutrients you need everyday.</p>
    <p><b>4-Weeks Plan Combines Foods for Maximum Nutrient Synergy&mdash;Nutrients Work Together for Maximum Health-Promoting Benefits</b></p>
    <p>A miracle food or nutrient has never been found because, as science continues to affirm, the "miracle" lies not with miracle nutrients or miracle foods but in a combination of nutrients and foods that work together to promote optimal health. This working together of nutrients is known as nutrient synergy. In the 4-Weeks Plan you get the best foods to eat and those foods provide the maximum health benefits when eaten together.</p>
    <p>At the same time the Plan provides 100% daily value of vitamins, minerals and other essential nutrients, it is providing a blend of nutrients&mdash;vitamins, minerals, fiber, fatty acids, antioxidants, phytonutrients, etc.&mdash;that work synergistically. This is what makes the 4-Weeks Plan so great and the reason why it helps prevent disease and promote health.</p>
    <p>An example is the interaction of nutrients necessary to maintain strong healthy bones. While calcium is highlighted as the "bone-building" nutrient, in actuality it cannot build strong bones without interacting with other nutrients such as vitamins K, C, D and other minerals such as magnesium, manganese, boron, copper and zinc as well as phytonutrients. The necessary phytonutrients will also be provided in the correct balance from the World's Healthiest Foods.</p>
    <p>A further example of why it.s important to enjoy a range of nutrient-rich foods in order to enjoy optimal health: To promote healthy blood pressure, you need not only require potassium but foods such as fruits, salads, and vegetables, which provide not only potassium but are rich in calcium, magnesium, omega-3, vitamin C, and folate.</p>
    <p>The bottom line: Since there is so much yet to be learned about individual nutrients and how they work together, it is only through eating a variety of whole foods, such as the World's Healthiest Foods and the 4-Weeks Plan that help you get everything your body needs to function optimally.</p>
    <p><b>Undiscovered Synergistic Effects of the 4-Weeks Plan: 40,000 Phytonutrients Yet to be Discovered!</b></p>
    <p>Did you know that science estimates 40,000 phytonutrients are yet to be identified? This is one of the greatest discoveries of the 20th century and one of the primary reasons why the foods included in the 4-Weeks Plan are the best for your health. Unidentified nutrients mean unidentified synergistic reactions between nutrients and unidentified health benefits from those nutrients and their interactions. It also means these nutrients cannot be isolated so the only way to assure that we reap their health-promoting benefits is to eat a variety of whole nutrient-rich foods (such as those found in the 4-Weeks Plan). Someday they will be identified and their specific roles in supporting a healthy immune system, cardiovascular system and reducing inflammation and reduce free radical activity will be recognized. Even then, enjoying foods such as the World's Healthiest Foods will be the best way to ensure that you will get their health-promoting benefits.</p>
    <p><b>Lose Those Extra Pounds with the 4-Weeks Plan and Maintain Healthy Weight Loss, Not by Depriving Yourself Through Dieting but by Enjoying the Healthiest Way of Eating</b></p>
    <p><img src="../newbook/14-Lose-pounds.jpg" align="right">Are you making the same mistake that many people make when they try to lose weight &mdash;just eat less and often feel hungry. Cutting down on your food intake can actually slow your metabolism; some people may actually gain weight while eating less. You can't fool a metabolic and hormonal system that's the result of thousands of years of evolution!</p>
    <p>Eating health-promoting nutrient-rich foods, such as the World's Healthiest Foods, optimizes your bodily functions and keeps your metabolism working optimally and feeling satiated. You will also eat fewer nutrient-poor foods (because you have no room) that do little to support a healthy metabolism and blood sugar levels.</p>
    <p><b>Losing Weight By Getting Healthier with the 4-Weeks Plan</b></p>
    <p>Rich in nutrients and low in calories&mdash;enjoying the nutrient-rich World's Healthiest Foods is the best way to permanently lose weight by getting healthier. Instead of being rich in calories, the World's Healthiest Foods are rich in nutrients and fiber. The vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber found in these foods will nourish your cells, reduce food cravings, and reduce your hunger because you will feel satiated. That means you will be less tempted to overeat and you not only get healthier but you can lose weight as well!</p>
    <p><b>You Will Never Go Hungry with the 4-Weeks Plan&mdash;You Can Even Enjoy Snacks and Dessert</b></p>
    <p><img src="../newbook/15-Never-go-hungry.jpg" align="left"> You will not ever go hungry if you follow the 4-Weeks Plan!<br>
    Losing weight doesn't mean you have to limit yourself to carrots and celery sticks. You don't have to deprive yourself to eat healthier. Almonds, walnuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, avocados, hummus, tahini, creamy yogurt, low-fat cheese, herb pesto and olives are often considered to be indulgences; however, enjoyed in moderation as a snack or dessert they can be both satisfying and healthy.</p>
    <p>Snacking can help maintain your blood sugar levels, curb your cravings, and keep you from gorging at the next meal. Snacking can actually be good for you.</p>
    <p>And on the 4-Weeks Plan you can even have dessert! I will show you how to make fruit desserts that can be prepared in a matter of minutes and are delicious.</p>

    <p><i>After less than four months of starting to eat the World's Healthiest Foods, I found my weight down almost 20 pounds, and my husband (whom I had not meant to go on a diet, but whose cook is, yes, me) had lost seven pounds as well. My energy level had increased as well, and the level of fruit and veggie intake had increased dramatically. Salads became an adventure, and the use of nuts and spices added zest to the foods.</i> - <b>Ann</b></p>

I was never overweight, but I still lost 10 pounds in the last year that I didn't need. My skin is healthy, and I have ample energy. My sexual vitality has increased, and I haven't had a cold in over a year -- two or three a year used to be my average. Friends and family have told me (without prompting!) how healthy I look.</i> - <b>Jonathan</b></p>
    <p><i>A New Life: I just wanted to email to say that your book has truly changed my life. At 22 years old I had just graduated college and was a complete mess; my diet was terrible, I couldn't fall asleep, I was suffering from anxiety, and I weighed 184 lbs which is a lot for someone of my height. My dad borrowed this book from his friend and I started flipping through it and found everything so interesting and appetizing. He quickly purchased it for me and the day I got it I started with the diet plan.</i></p>
    <p><i>For 4-Weeks straight I ate nothing but food from your book and I suddenly felt amazing. I can gladly say that now, with the help of your recipes plus yoga and pilates, that I weigh 145lbs! Not only did I lose weight but my entire metabolism changed. I no longer had any desire for sweets, or high fat food and the occasional time I do I find that I don't gain weight as quickly. I have lost weight in the past from other diets but always gain it back once I go back to eating badly but this is not a diet, it.s a way of life. I swear by your book and make recipes for all my friends and they are picky eaters and love them!</i></p>
    <p><i>For the first time in my life I feel so happy to just be me... my mood has completely changed, I'm motivated, I have confidence. I feel healthy! Not once do I feel deprived because like I said I don't have cravings anymore! My friends ask me how I do it and I tell them... its all about The World's Healthiest foods. I feel great and I'm still losing weight! Now I can't wait to get into that bride's maids dress! Thank you so much, for changing my life.</i> - <b>Amy</b></p>

Unlike allergies, sensitivities are not mediated by the immune system, but because they involve many different physiological mechanisms their prevalence is extremely high.
