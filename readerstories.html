          <p class="rdrquote">Dear Mr. Mateljan, Thank you for your excellent and highly trustworthy website and newsletters. I appreciate very much the in-depth nutrition information you provide. I donated $25 to your foundation yesterday. My donation to the George Mateljan Foundation is a way for me to thank you for the valuable information you provide on your website and in your newsletters. - Elizbeth F. January 2018</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">Dear George: Your site was the first I went to to begin learning about nutrition. Your site is the cutting edge -- way, way ahead of other sites in terms of new information on the nutritional values in food. You were the very first place that discussed inflammation as the root of all disease. When this fact because mainstream I was already aware because of your site. I go to your site daily reading and re-reading about the world’s healthiest foods I am so much happier and healthier because of this information. I am trying to educate my family but even here in progressive California we do not know and believe the scientific facts. Hopefully with your work and the exhaustive work of other doctors; Michael Gregor, Neil Barnard, Joel Fuhrman, etc our nation can see the profound toxic results of unhealthy eating and even the poorer communities can get the support they need even if it’s simply eating more frozen vegetables if fresh is not available. - Cynthia P. December 2017</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">Dear George, many blessings are coming your way for our terrific services to mankind. - Gertrude B. December 2017</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">Dear George, thank you very much for all your super information i really enjoy reading everything happy new year. - Debbie D. December 2017</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">Dear George, Thank you for your very informative healthy eating info! I contribute my good health to the many ways I have changed my eating habits- thanks to you! - Elizabeth G. December 2017</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">Dear George, when I make any recipe of yours they always love it. They ask where is the recipe from... I say George of course. Thank you for the recipes and how long to cook food the most healthy. I am teaching my 6 year old granddaughter how to cook this way. She loves to cook. She helps me get the garlic ready. - Debbie G. August 2017</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">Dear George, thank you for a truly wonderful resource. This resource is written in a clear, scientific and easily understood manner. It brings together amazing health knowledge, which also appeals to the palate. Again, thank you for a valuable, intellectually sound and educational resource which brings me toward a better understanding of the value of food. I greatly appreciate, respect and value your contribution to a healthier, happier world. - Brenda M. August 2017</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">Dear George, this was an excellent dish which we enjoyed! I found it so delicious and it went well with the food combining way of eating I'm trying out in order to better control blood sugar levels due to type 1 diabetes, which I've struggled with for over 50 years. I did not have to take any insulin after this lunch followed by a walk; such a plus! - Lucy B. July 2017</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">Dear George, I have your book and love the recipes that I try and want to do more. I am very busy with several jobs and a family and find I often do not have time to sit and think about the next meal and settle for cooking food that is not the best for my health. Do you have an actual menu planner in a book that has substitute meals on it that I can just follow daily? - Jenny S. August 2018</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">Dear George, I love and enjoy all your recipes. They're food for all of us, I am going to try this salad. - Blanca B. July 2017</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">Dear George, I have become addicted to our oat, raspberry, blueberry breakfast. Couldn't find pumpkin seeds, so I chopped up some walnut. Since it's fresh strawberry time here in Germany, I added some sliced strawberries too. The cinnamon gives it a very special and yummy taste! - Astrid E. June 2017</p>

          <p class="rdrquote">Dear George, Thank you for everything you do for all of us! I also have your book from the 80's.

I have two of your new books on order, one for myself, and one for a gift!! I found your site while researching foods listed within an allergy elimination diet (self imposed) that I'm undertaking, and your site has been sooooo helpful!! You have also inspired me (already) to try new things. Again, thank you from the bottom of my heart for all you do!!!!! Kindest Regards - LO</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">Thank you for all the healthy recipes. You do a great job on educating the people on how to cook. I try to follow your lead. - Cathy</p>

          <p class="rdrquote">Dear George - First of all, thank you for your wonderful website, which I think is a treasure of information! I read articles on nutrition, and get recipes and nutrient values of various foods at your website. I find yours the very best website on food and nutrition, and I want to commend you for your professionalism and dedication. Thank you! You are making the world a better place, so God bless you! I never get sick either. I have gone 30 years now without a cold--since my youngest child was in kindergarten! No one but my husband believes me, but it is true. I avoid all junk food and genetically modified food, as well as commercially raised meats. I think it is well worth the money and effort to buy organic produce, nuts, seeds, teas, sweeteners and grains, grass-fed beef and bison, and pasture raised, organic chickens and their eggs. We do not need a doctor or take any prescriptions--nor do we ever intend to. We believe that good food is the "secret" to good health--which seems incredibly obvious, yet so many people don't realize it! Thank you again for the service you are providing to people around the world! - Margaret</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">Dear George, I just wanted to follow up with you about my good news. I met with my doctor today to go over my bloodwork numbers. He told me he had never seen anyone improve in 3 months the way I had. He said it was like looking at a completely different person. He asked, "What have you been doing." I told him about your website and how your daily emails inspired me to eat healthy. He wrote your website down and was going to check out some of your recipes that I told him about. He asked if it would be okay for him to send my numbers to the TN health department. He thought they might want to interview me. I hope they do. I've been telling everyone about whfoods.org and I'll tell them about it too. Once again, thank you for your help in getting my health better. God bless - Tim</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">Hi George Mateljan - I just want to thank you for your awesome website and content. I love the information you have given there and appreciate all of the research that has gone into our site. AND I LOVE THE RECIPES. - RS</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">Thank you so much for sharing all of your knowledge and insight on your site! I'm finding it especially helpful since I'm looking into turning over a new leaf and eating healthier than I do now. - TI</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">Warmest greetings to you. I e-mailed you several years ago expressing my appreciation for the work you do in putting together the whfoods website. Today, I was inspired to visit your site yet again (losing count of how often I visit www.whfoods.com) and honestly, the site is so beautiful each time I browse through. God Bless you for your services in educating readers on how to live and eat more healthfully. A loyal friend from India - VI</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">Appreciation: George's philanthropy has done more for mankind than any sum of money could have. For opening our eyes to the nutrients we never knew we were forgetting in our diet, I say thank you to the George Mateljan Foundation and staff. The fact that corporations and industries have no say in this information makes it 100% more genuine. - AR</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">I love your website. Thanks for the excellence you display in your search for nutrition truth. It's heartening to know there are people like you working hard to bring top quality information out of journals and other sources and into public awareness. Your site is indeed the best source for nutrition-related information anywhere. - PA</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">HI George, Just dropping a note to thank you for your inspiring articles on nutrition. I have recently read your articles on blueberries, strawberries and am left with great feelings of enthusiasm and hope for the future of my heath, cognitive and otherwise. As a type 2 diabetic in my 60's I've been feeling rather depressed about my prospects for a healthy old age recently, especially cognitively. But reading your articles I feel a weight of dread and despondency lift from off my shoulders, so informative and reassuring is the scope and tone of your writing. Also, for the first time in my life I feel inspired to learn about COOKING and nutrition in detail as you really seem to connect it in a very tight way with medicine and healing, in fact as a form of natural PHARMACY. I don't want to be sick, so my first cook book will be yours. Again thank you. - Charles</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">You may have just saved my life: I have never offered a comment on anyone's website except for now. As a former bodybuilder I remembered the basics of diet but nothing worked. Hundreds of supplements available. Hundreds of Protein Powders. Hundreds of Specific Chemicals. I had no way of determining what I should buy and how much and for what, etc.? I have wasted so much money on hoping to find a simple, manageable diet that is COMPLETE and AFFORDABLE. All of the above changed about 45 minutes ago. I was reviewing the National Institutes of Health site on supplements which led me to MedLine which led me to your site. YOU HAVE ANSWERED ALL OF MY QUESTIONS IN 45 FREAKING MINUTES...DUDE! YOU ROCK!!!!!!!!! Oh my dear lord, if the American People knew this there would be a revolution. Just wanted to express my thanks! - Paull</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">Dear George and everyone at the World's Healthiest foods. I want to sincerely thank you for your excellent healthy food advice. When I was growing up I ate a lot of things like sugary snacks and snack cakes and greasy foods. But I have begun to take your advice and I feel healthier and I am healthier in my food choices. One of my favorite things you helped me learn is that sardines are good for us. I love sardines and I like to put them into various recipes as a replacement for tuna, and, I like to eat them as is. I also like tomato products which I learned from you are very good. I love to eat fresh tomatoes like I eat apples. Thank you very much for your great advice! - Aaron</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">Thank you very much for your kind and generous contribution to our well being. - Evelin</p>

          <p class="rdrquote">Great site: You have a wonderful site. As a registered dietitian I am constantly researching the latest valid information as well as the latest misinformation to help guide my clients. I appreciate that you include references and names of the contributing writers. And from what I have read so far this site seems to be very up-to-date, reliable, and common sense. Thanks for a great resource! - PG</p>
          <p class="rdrquote">I would first like to say how much I love your site and how grateful I am that you offer this incredible resource to the public. I have shared your information with many friends and family members, and continue to use it as my "go to" for anything food related. My question is: although I have researched which apple is the most nutritious, I would greatly appreciate your recommendation. I live in Ontario, Canada. Thank you so much! - RA</p>

          <p class="rdrquote">Hi George, thank you for that informative educational newsletter. I grew up on the Caribbean islands of Grenada and Trinidad &amp; Tobago so I know about healthy eating. Everything was natural and fresh and almost everyone grew their food. Our foods were never processed, no additives or preservatives, fresh from the ground or the tree to the pot. Our fishes were directly from the sea to the pot. Everyone were active, vibrant and energetic. When someone died she/he was almost 100 years old. People were never sick or bedridden unless you are mentally disabled. In NYC, the people who are in my age group look so old and the younger ones look older than me. It's what we eat and what is in our foods. You are doing great work. Thank you for your extraordinary service to mankind. - AN</p>

          <p class="rdrquote">Wonderful results: Last year I ordered a copy of the new Healthiest Foods book and sent it to my brother &amp; his wife who were having health issues. We have changed the way we eat and it's working! Rob will go in soon for lab tests, and to talk to his CNP, but I recently got lab results back that were pretty astonishing. I truly thought the lab had made a mistake, given me someone else's results! But the kidney profile was mine, just very nicely improved. My cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL and ratios were some of the best I've ever had in my adult life. All were perfectly normal, some actually better than normal. And I was really delighted with my CRP (a test for body-wide inflammation) and it was the lowest it has ever been: 1.57. Two years ago it was 9.8, dangerously high for heart attack, and last spring it had improved some to 5.4, which was still considered dangerous, and the last reading was the lowest, now in the average range for an adult with no past history of heart disease. I was totally astonished. I also have lower blood sugars, lower cholesterol, and lower blood pressure plus increased kidney function. Thanks for all you do. - SY</p>

It is also a first recommendation to clients and students. This summer my brother was visiting from out of town and put his hands on my copy of George's book. He and his wife are in their 60s and, on the average, healthy eaters. However, like many of us, they shy away from some foods because they are unaware of simple preparation methods, the outstanding health benefits or have been lead to believe that some foods are NOT healthy, when in fact they are. Long and short I couldn't pry the thing out of his hands. Thanks for all your hard work! - JE</p>
