I will be using your website as a resource for creating educational materials to help individuals in my coaching classes to make sound lifestyle choices to stay fit, live longer, feel better, look better and remain healthy for the rest of their lives. Our program centers on the core foundation of good health-sensible eating, a positive state of mind and consistent, sustainable life management techniques. Thank you! - GI</p>
<p class="rdrquote">I love your website. It is a go-to site for me when searching for nutrition value in food items, and the site is so user friendly, as it is extremely easy to navigate through. I find your site wonderful to use, and trust the information you provide. - BE</p>
<p class="rdrquote">Firstly, let me take this opportunity to thank you for your lovely and informative articles through your newsletter. I've also read parts of your ebook and all that info has helped me maintain good health. - SH</p>
<p class="rdrquote">Thank you!: Hey guys, Just wanted to say thank you for all the nutritional information you provide for so many different foods, and wanted to let you know that we'd linked up to some of your nutritional info pages on our recent post.  Hope you get some traffic from it! Have an amazing day and thank you so much for all the great info! Cheers. - JO</p>
<p class="rdrquote">Dear George, Thank you so much for taking an interest in nutrition and then sharing it with the rest of us. I will be forever grateful---being a cancer survivor (I am back on chemo drug Gleevec) and believe my problem is dietary in nature. This is the newest that I have read on EVOO. AGAIN THANK YOU!  - JA</p>
<p class="rdrquote">We love your book and we are thinking of including it our gift basket to our son. - Eva</p>
<p class="rdrquote">Thank you so much for your excellent nutritional newsletters and advice. - EL</p>
<p class="rdrquote">I have been enjoying your amazing website for about a year now. I have learned so much from you  and look forward to my on going education in nutrition. I pass on your web address often. I have been a massage therapist for 26 years and my clients are often interested it nutritional information. Thank you for being willing to share with us, all the  knowledge you have acquired. I find it very helpful in my daily living. I also want to thank you for your time. - TI</p>
<p class="rdrquote">. . . Now you have to admit reading your site is not like reading a novel, but every day I read and study one food item. You have been of tremendous help, I was able to cut my insulin consumption down by 80% and sometimes only need one shot a day. Needless to say I am now addicted to spinach and your website. Thanks. - JU</p>
<p class="rdrquote">I greatly admire your work, have relied on your web site for quite a while, and have your book and video.  I am thankful for your work promoting a healthful way of living, since it probably helped me avoid some of the worst symptoms of my health condition. - JE</p>
<p class="rdrquote">I am enjoying your emails and website tremendously. Thanks so much for what you do. - Judd</p>
<p class="rdrquote">GMO information: Thank you for the information you have posted on your site regarding GMO's and GE products. I have been looking for a balanced, thoughtful description of GMO's. It seems most information is laced with personal attacks on Monsanto or the concept of GMO's. While I appreciate individual opinions, those opinions do not help me to understand the concept and concerns of GMO's. As a wellness coordinator I like to provide information to my clients that is not laced with personal rhetoric. Instead I want to provide them factual information so they can choose for themselves what is best for their life. I will be recommending your site to my clients as a healthy lifestyle resource. Thank you so much. Respectfully. - AM</p>
<p class="rdrquote">Thank you George for those insightful articles. They are so very enlightening. - JO</p>
<p class="rdrquote">Your article on breakthrough info on salmon fish is excellent and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. It is very informative. - EV</p>
<p class="rdrquote">Thank you George for all your excellent and educated articles. - DA</p>
<p class="rdrquote">Accolades: I just wanted to thank you for your superb, weekly newsletter. WHF provides comprehensive and salient information on nutritionally-superior foods - sorely needed in this time of reduced expectation and inadequate noshing. All the best in your endeavours. I salute your integrity! Regards. - JO</p>
<p class="rdrquote">Hi, I absolutely LOVE your website. It is well referenced and dispels some common myths. Your article about goitrogenic foods was excellent. I am a physician based in Boston MA. I am boarded in emergency medicine and integrative medicine. Thanks again for an awesome website. - SO</p>
<p class="rdrquote">I really enjoy the excellent nutritional information you send out, and the cooking videos for healthier food prep. Thank-you for helping us be healthier! - AN</p>
<p class="rdrquote">I appreciate your great work and have been getting a lot of your book, "The Worlds Healthiest Foods"; it is fantastic! - PA</p>
