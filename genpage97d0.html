          </ul>
          <h3>Healthy Eating is the World's Healthiest Foods Way of Eating</h3>
          <p>Most people think that eating healthy is difficult and that it also means sacrificing taste. This is a misconception, which we believe we can dispel here at World's Healthiest Foods as we show you the <b>World's Healthiest Food Way of Eating</b> that is not only highly nutritious but tastes great!</p>
          <p>Eating is one of the few things we do every single day. And since most of us eat 3 or more meals a day we are eating over 1,000 meals a year!

The <b>World's Healthiest Foods Way of Eating</b> is designed to help you make decisions that will optimize your health. And it can be done in 3 easy steps:</p>

            <li>Step 1&nbsp;&nbsp;Select health-promoting, nutrient-rich <a href="foodstoc.html">World's Healthiest Foods</a>.
            </li>

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The <b>World's Healthiest Foods Way of Eating</b> is for those for whom eating is not merely a reaction to "hunger" but for those who want to eat for nourishment and better health. The new <b>World's Healthiest Foods Way of Eating</b> goes far beyond taking in calories and satisfying hunger; it is a way to enjoy great tasting food, which will nourish your body. If you want to eat more healthfully, the <b>World's Healthiest Foods Way of Eating</b> does all the work for you. It takes out all of the guesswork and makes healthy eating creative, fun, easy and enjoyable.</p>
          <h4>Nutrient-Richness is the Paradigm at the Core of the World's Healthiest Foods Way of Eating</h4>
          <p>Nutrient-richness is the key to the <b>World's Healthiest Foods Way of Eating</b>. It is the measurement of how many nutrients (vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, protein, fiber, carbohydrates, omega-3 fatty acids, and phytonutrients) you will receive from your food for the least number of calories.</p>
          <center>
            <table>
              <tr>
                <td valign="middle" align="center">Nutrient-Richness</td>
                <td valign="middle">=</td>
                <td valign="middle" align="center">
                  Maximum Nutrients
                  <hr style="color:black;height:1px;background-color:black">
                  Minimal Calories
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </center>
          <p>Our body requires over 50 vitamins, minerals, fiber, fatty acids, and amino acids every day to operate efficiently and keep us healthy. All of these nutrients can be found in the nutrient-rich World's Healthiest Foods.</p>
          <h4>Why the World's Healthiest Foods Should Be Your Foods of Choice</h4>
          <p>The World's Healthiest Foods are among the most nutrient-rich foods in the world and therefore help promote optimal health by providing you with maximum nutrition and taste for the least number of calories. They ensure your body is receiving the necessary amount of nutrients it needs. Along with vitamins, minerals, protein, fiber, and omega-3 fatty acids they are concentrated in antioxidants and phytonutrients, which combat free radicals that can damage DNA and cellular structures, as well as act as powerful anti-inflammatory agents.</p>
          <p>We always recommend selecting nutrient-rich World's Healthiest Foods for our body to function optimally and inspire well-being. The <b>World's Healthiest Foods Way of Eating</b> may help you enjoy more energy, strong bones, healthy skin, good sleep, and other aspects of optimal wellness. Alternatively, a diet that emphasizes nutrient-poor foods may lead to symptoms of nutrient deficiency: low energy, unhealthy skin, poor heart health, an inability to sleep, and reduced ability to cope with stress.</p>
          <p>Our <a href="foodstoc.html">List of World's Healthiest Foods</a> highlights the 100 foods, which I have found to be among the world's healthiest. I created this list after 40 years of traveling around the globe searching for the foods associated with cultures recognized for their exceptional health and longevity.</p>
          <p>For each food you will find a description of the food; how to select, store, prepare, and cook the food; its health benefits; and its nutritional profile. The list of World's Healthiest Foods helps you to select which of the nutrient-rich foods fit your personal tastes and nutritional needs. There may also be times when you are interested in increasing the intake of a particular nutrient. In that case click on the link to the nutrient in which you are interested from our list of <a href="nutrientstoc.html">Essential Nutrients</a> and find which of the World's Healthiest Foods is most concentrated in that particular nutrient.</p>
          <p>And every week we feature one of the World's Healthiest Foods on the <a href="index.html">home page</a> &mdash;a food that is currently in season when it has the best flavor and is the least expensive.</p>
          <h4>Enjoy the World's Healthiest Foods in the Powerful WHFoods Meal Plan</h4>
          <p>The WHFoods Meal Plan was designed to show how it is possible to get 100% of nutrients from food alone without the use of supplements. For over 30 years George read it would be impossible for food alone to supply enough nutrients to promote optimal health, but that's what the WHFoods Meal Plan is all about. It supplies you with over 100% of most nutrients your body needs. Each nutrient has a specific role to play in the regeneration of the approximately 300 billion new cells created by our bodies each day! For these cells to be healthy, proper nutritional intake is a must. And because nutrients work synergistically, the Meal Plan provides the variety of nutrients to support their synergistic interaction. The nutrients concentrated in the World's Healthiest Foods featured in the Meal Plan also provide anti-inflammatory protection for a healthier cardiovascular system and a stronger immune system as well as protection against the free radical activity that can damage cellular structures and DNA.</p>
          <p>These include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Protein-rich foods that scientific studies have found to promote healthy skin, hair, and nails</li>
            <li>Vitamin K2-rich foods that scientific studies have found to promote the absorption of calcium and prevent osteoporosis</li>
            <li>Vitamin A-rich foods that scientific studies have found to help support a healthy immune system, prevent frequent colds and flues, and promote healthy vision</li>
            <li>Vitamin C-rich foods that scientific studies have found to help reduce free radical damage to cells.</li>
            <li>Fiber-Rich Foods that scientific studies have found to help support the health of the digestive system</li>
            <li>Folate-rich foods that scientific studies have found to help support cardiovascular health.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>And many more. . . .</p>
          <p>You will love the foods in the <b>WHFoods Meal Plan</b>: sweet fruit, rich in antioxidants vitamins, minerals, and fiber; great tasting vegetables, rich in immune-boosting nutrients; a crunchy fresh salad that is full of enzymes and alive with flavor; a great omega-3-rich fish recipe; beans and legumes rich in folate, protein, and fiber; and nuts and seeds that are great for snacks.</p>
          <h4>The WHFoods Meal Plan Promotes Synergistic Interaction of Nutrients</h4>
          <p>Nutrients do not work alone but in concert (synergistically) with other nutrients in foods. The <b>WHFoods Meal Plan</b> works to promote beneficial nutrient interaction and allows for the synergistic reactions between nutrients essential for optimal health. The benefit of deriving nutrients from eating fresh whole foods such as those included on the list of the World's Healthiest Foods is that they provide not only an abundance of individual nutrients but also the variety necessary for their optimal function.</p>
          <p>One good example of how the synergistic interaction between nutrients in foods works is in regards to bone health. The importance of calcium is almost always featured as the nutrient necessary for maintaining strong, healthy bones. The reality is that strong bones also need vitamins D and K2, magnesium, and trace minerals like boron. All of these nutrients are not concentrated in one food but in a combination of foods. Of course, milk and yogurt supply are great sources of calcium and salmon is a wonderful source of those hard-to-find omega-3 fatty acids. So, as you can see by eating a range of delicious foods you'll enjoy great taste and promote better bone health.</p>
          <p>The <b>WHFoods Meal Plan</b> was designed to show how it is possible to get 100% of nutrients from food alone without the use of supplements.</p>

          <h4>The World's Healthiest Foods Way of Eating Includes Nutrient-Rich Cooking</h4>
          <p>Nutrient-Rich Cooking is an integral part of the <b>World's Healthiest Foods Way of Eating</b>. George was inspired to develop <a href="genpageb222.html?tname=george&amp;dbid=360">Nutrient-Rich Cooking</a> when he found that traditional cooking methods could lose up to 50-80% of the vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytonutrients found in food! To George that meant that even if he was purchasing the most nutrient-rich foods available, it was possible that he was not enjoying many of their health-promoting benefits because if the foods were not cooked properly he was not enjoying the full range of their nutrient potential.</p>
          <p>The new Nutrient-Rich Way of Cooking will take you out of the dark age of traditional cooking. You will discover how great vegetables can taste and how tenderizing their fibers by cooking them al dente helps release their naturally wonderful and complex flavors.</p>
          <p>We have long been aware that no matter how good a food is for you, no one will eat it if it doesn't taste good. That's why George places equal importance on maximizing nutrition and taste when developing his Nutrient-Rich Cooking. And because Nutrient-Rich Cooking is quick and easy, it is a perfect fit in today's busy lifestyle.</p>
          <p>To put George's cooking methods into practice the whfoods.org website provides you with at-home cooking demonstrations, and an extensive library of <a href="index.html?#recipes">hundreds of recipes</a> , many of which you will find in the <b>WHFoods Meal Plan</b>.

          <h4>A Lifestyle Change to the World's Healthiest Foods Way of Eating</h4>
          <p>Modern science now concurs that among all lifestyle factors, no single factor is more important to our health than the food we eat. According to healthcare experts, our best bet in avoiding chronic preventable disease rates does not lie in more expensive medical procedures, or in more sophisticated technology, or in further specialization with respect to testing and medication. Our best bet, experts agree, lies in the simple, everyday practice of a lifestyle change in the foods that we eat.</p>
          <p>We could be saving millions of lives and several hundred billion dollars in healthcare costs related to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer if we would eat more health-promoting, nutrient-rich foods like the World's Healthiest Foods&mdash;foods that the peer-reviewed medical research has already suggested may help prevent these diseases.</p>
          <p>What's also remarkable about the chronic preventable disease patterns described above is the degree to which they overlap when it comes to dietary prevention. Based on current research, we do not seem to need one diet for preventing heart disease, a second diet for preventing diabetes, a third diet for preventing obesity, and a fourth diet for preventing cancer.</p>
          <p>What seems to be needed in the case of all four chronic preventable diseases is that the changes in the foods we eat move in the same general direction: decreased intake of sugar, salt, animal fat, and processed foods, and increased intake of health-promoting, nutrient-rich foods World's Healthiest Foods. Dietary prevention in the case of all four chronic preventable diseases calls for a greater focus on health-promoting foods and a healthier way of eating that can be followed and enjoyed day after day, year after year.</p>
          <p>Nutrient-rich foods like the World's Healthiest foods are the keys to a healthy lifestyle. It is the source of good health and energy.

Eating more nutrient-rich foods, cooking them properly, and learning about how to create a better way of eating by following the Plan will help you feel stronger and healthier.
